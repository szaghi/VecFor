The components of the vectors are reals with parametrized kind as defined by the library module. The components are defined in a three-dimensional cartesian frame of reference. All the vectorial math procedures (cross, dot products, parallel...) assume a three-dimensional cartesian frame of reference. The operators of assignment (<code>=</code>), multiplication (<code>*</code>), division (<code>/</code>), sum (<code>+</code>) and subtraction (<code>-</code>) have been overloaded. Furthermore the <em>dot</em> and <em>cross</em> products have been defined. Therefore this module provides a far-complete algebra based on Vector derived type.</p><p><strong>Source</strong>: <code>src/lib/vecfor.F90</code></p><p><strong>Dependencies</strong></p>',5)),(o(),n(l,null,{default:r(()=>[f(a,{id:"mermaid-17",class:"mermaid",graph:"graph%20LR%0A%20%20vecfor%5B%22vecfor%22%5D%20--%3E%20vecfor_R16P%5B%22vecfor_R16P%22%5D%0A%20%20vecfor%5B%22vecfor%22%5D%20--%3E%20vecfor_R4P%5B%22vecfor_R4P%22%5D%0A%20%20vecfor%5B%22vecfor%22%5D%20--%3E%20vecfor_R8P%5B%22vecfor_R8P%22%5D%0A%20%20vecfor%5B%22vecfor%22%5D%20--%3E%20vecfor_RPP%5B%22vecfor_RPP%22%5D%0A"})]),fallback:r(()=>[...e[0]||(e[0]=[i(" Loading...
